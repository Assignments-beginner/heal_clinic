Dermatologists have extensive training, going to school for 12 years or more to learn to diagnose and treat more than 3,000 diseases of the skin, hair, and nails as well as cosmetic concerns. Patients see dermatologists for issues that are much more than skin deep.

Now, the main concern has shifted to the COVID-19 vaccine and its effect on pregnancy. New data shows that the vaccine is safe for both the mother and child, despite the ongoing misconceptions and false claims. According to Brant Cooper, MD at Women’s Care, health officials are much more confident about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine than just six months ago. With the Delta variant surge, it is important to consider vaccination to protect yourself, your community and your baby.",
